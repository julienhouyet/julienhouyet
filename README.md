## I’m Julien Houyet, Senior Full-Stack Developer. 🥷🏻

Young web enthusiast, I started learning HTML/CSS/PHP at the age of 11. It was only natural for me to turn it into my profession later on. I began working as a student in the field in 2010 and have made it my main occupation since 2012. Being self-taught, I enjoy constantly educating myself on new web technologies. 

I'm currently studying at 19 in Brussels (42 network) to learn C, C++, Python, Ruby, Javascript ...
