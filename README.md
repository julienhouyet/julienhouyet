## 🥷🏻 Hi, I’m Julien Houyet — Full-Stack Developer with an entrepreneurial background.

I started building websites at the age of 11 with HTML, CSS, and PHP.  
Over the years, I naturally moved into entrepreneurship and co-founded several digital projects, where I worked on product vision, coordination of teams and technical decision-making.

After these entrepreneurial experiences, I made a deliberate choice:  
to strengthen my technical foundations and focus fully on development.

I later followed the curriculum at **42**, where I consolidated my skills in software development, problem-solving and clean architecture.  
Today, I work as a full-stack developer, combining **product thinking**, **technical execution**, and **real-world business constraints**.

I enjoy building clear, maintainable and useful applications — not just writing code, but contributing to products that make sense.
